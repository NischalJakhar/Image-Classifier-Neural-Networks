# # Introduction
# 
# In this project, you will build a neural network of your own design to evaluate the CIFAR-10 dataset.
# 
# To meet the requirements for this project, you will need to achieve an accuracy greater than 45%. 
# If you want to beat Detectocorp's algorithm, you'll need to achieve an accuracy greater than 70%. 
# (Beating Detectocorp's algorithm is not a requirement for passing this project, but you're encouraged to try!)
# 
# Some of the benchmark results on CIFAR-10 include:
# 
# 78.9% Accuracy | [Deep Belief Networks; Krizhevsky, 2010](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/conv-cifar10-aug2010.pdf)
# 
# 90.6% Accuracy | [Maxout Networks; Goodfellow et al., 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4389.pdf)
# 
# 96.0% Accuracy | [Wide Residual Networks; Zagoruyko et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146.pdf)
# 
# 99.0% Accuracy | [GPipe; Huang et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06965.pdf)
# 
# 98.5% Accuracy | [Rethinking Recurrent Neural Networks and other Improvements for ImageClassification; Nguyen et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15161.pdf)
# 
# Research with this dataset is ongoing. Notably, many of these networks are quite large and quite expensive to train.

# ## Imports

# In[1]:


## This cell contains the essential imports you will need – DO NOT CHANGE THE CONTENTS! ##
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


# ## Load the Dataset
# 
# Specify your transforms as a list first.
# The transforms module is already loaded as `transforms`.
# 
# CIFAR-10 is fortunately included in the torchvision module.
# Then, you can create your dataset using the `CIFAR10` object from `torchvision.datasets` ([the documentation is available here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#cifar)).
# Make sure to specify `download=True`! 
# 
# Once your dataset is created, you'll also need to define a `DataLoader` from the `torch.utils.data` module for both the train and the test set.

# In[3]:


# Define transforms
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomRotation(10),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465], 
                         std=[0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010])
])


# Create training set and define training dataloader
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
import torchvision.datasets as datasets
trainset = datasets.CIFAR10('~/.pytorch/CIFAR10_data/', download=True, train=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Validation Set Definition
train_size = int(0.8 * len(trainset))  # 80% of data for training
val_size = len(trainset) - train_size  # Remaining 20% for validation
train_subset, val_subset = torch.utils.data.random_split(trainset, [train_size, val_size])

valloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(val_subset, batch_size=64, shuffle=False)


# Create test set and define test dataloader
## YOUR CODE HERE ##
testset = datasets.CIFAR10('~/.pytorch/CIFAR10_data/', download=True, train=False, transform=transform)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# The 10 classes in the dataset
classes = ('plane', 'car', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck')


# ## Explore the Dataset
# Using matplotlib, numpy, and torch, explore the dimensions of your data.
# 
# You can view images using the `show5` function defined below – it takes a data loader as an argument.
# Remember that normalized images will look really weird to you! You may want to try changing your transforms to view images.
# Typically using no transforms other than `toTensor()` works well for viewing – but not as well for training your network.
# If `show5` doesn't work, go back and check your code for creating your data loaders and your training/test sets.

# In[4]:


def show5(img_loader):
    dataiter = iter(img_loader)
    
    batch = next(dataiter)
    labels = batch[1][0:5]
    images = batch[0][0:5]
    for i in range(5):
        print(classes[labels[i]])
    
        image = images[i].numpy()
        plt.imshow(np.rot90(image.T, k=3))
        plt.show()

# ## Build your Neural Network
# Using the layers in `torch.nn` (which has been imported as `nn`) and the `torch.nn.functional` module (imported as `F`), construct a neural network based on the parameters of the dataset. 
# Feel free to construct a model of any architecture – feedforward, convolutional, or even something more advanced!

# Use whatever method you like to train your neural network, and ensure you record the average loss at each epoch.

# ## Make a Recommendation
# 
# Based on your evaluation, what is your recommendation on whether to build or buy? Explain your reasoning below.
# 
# Some things to consider as you formulate your recommendation:
# * How does your model compare to Detectocorp's model?
# * How does it compare to the far more advanced solutions in the literature? 
# * What did you do to get the accuracy you achieved? 
# * Is it necessary to improve this accuracy? If so, what sort of work would be involved in improving it?

# I recommend to **build** the model in-house as our model achieves an accuracy of 71%, surpassing Detectocorp's performance target of 70%.
# 
# **Comparison to Advanced Solutions:**
# 
# While advanced models such as Wide Residual Networks and Maxout Networks have the potential to outperform our model in terms of accuracy, they come with significantly increased complexity and computational requirements. 
# 
# For CIFAR-10, our CNN model already provides a competitive balance of efficiency and performance.
# 
# **What Was Done to Achieve Current Accuracy:**
# 
# (i) We used three convolutional layers and appropriate pooling and fully connected layers.
# 
# (ii) Dropout was introduced to mitigate overfitting.
# 
# (iii) Data augmentation (e.g., random rotations, flips) improved the robustness of our model.
# 
# (iv) A suitable optimizer (Adam) and learning rate were selected, balancing convergence speed and stability
# 
# **Is Further Accuracy Improvement Necessary?**
# 
# Improving accuracy beyond 70% depends on the business need. If the task requires highly reliable predictions, further accuracy improvements are necessary. If the goal is cost-effectiveness while maintaining Detectocorp-level performance, the current solution is sufficient.
# 
# **Steps to Further Improve Accuracy:**
# 
# (i) Add additional augmentation techniques, such as color jitter or brightness adjustments
# 
# (ii) Use tools like Optuna or grid search to optimize learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate
# 
# (iii) Train for more epochs or use learning rate schedulers for gradual decay
